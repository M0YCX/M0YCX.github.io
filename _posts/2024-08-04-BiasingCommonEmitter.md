Continuing reading Wes Hayward's Introduction to Radio Frequency Design and had a go at rewriting
the EMRFD Ladpac-2008 biasnpn08.exe program in Python as an interactive
Jupyter Notebook:-

see: [Biasing Common Emitter Notebook](https://github.com/M0YCX/ycx_rf_notebooks/blob/master/Amplifiers/biasing/Common%20Emitter%20Biasing.ipynb)

The slider controls allow you to select resistor values from the E24 series.
