I'm very much a beginner (and I think i will always be as such...) in the field of Amateur Radio and
RF Electronics/Theory.  This site is to capture anything interesting I work on that I can share.

Content can be discussed etc in github at [M0YCX](https://github.com/orgs/M0YCX/discussions).

Enjoy!  M0YCX
